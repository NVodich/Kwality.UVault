Installation
============

Before working with UVault's Identity & access management component, you will need to add a reference to
Kwality.UVault.IAM.dll in your project. The simplest way to do this is to use either the NuGet package manager, or the
dotnet CLI.

Using the NuGet package manager console within Visual Studio run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    Install-Package Kwality.UVault.IAM

Or using the .net core CLI from a terminal window:

.. code-block:: console

    dotnet add package Kwality.UVault.IAM
