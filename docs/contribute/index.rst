Contributing to UVault
======================

Few open-source projects are going to be successful without contributions and UVault is no exception to this rule.
We are deeply grateful for all contributions no matter their size.

Finding existing issues
-----------------------

Before filing a new issue, please use our `issue tracker <https://github.com/dotnet-essentials/Kwality.UVault/issues>`_
to check if it already exists.

.. note::
  If you do find an existing issue, please include your own feedback in the discussion.
  Instead of posting "me too", upvote the issue with üëç, as this better helps us prioritize popular issues and avoids
  spamming people who are subscribed to the issue.

Writing a Good Bug Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Good bug reports make it easier for maintainers to verify and root cause the underlying problem.
The better a bug report, the faster the problem will be resolved.
Ideally, a bug report should contain the following information:

* A high-level description of the problem.
* A minimal reproduction, i.e. the smallest size of code/configuration required to reproduce the wrong behavior.
* A description of the expected behavior, contrasted with the actual behavior observed.
* Information on the environment: nuget version, .NET version, etc.
* Additional information, e.g. is it a regression from previous versions? are there any known workarounds?

When ready to submit a bug report, please use the
`Bug report <https://github.com/dotnet-essentials/Kwality.UVault/issues/new/choose>`_ issue template.

Contributing Changes
--------------------

UVault's core library very rarely accepts changes which introduces extra dependencies.
If you feel the need to add an extra dependency, think about a design where this extra dependency can be added in
another project instead of UVault's core library.

In order for UVault to provide a consistent experience across the library, we generally want to review every single API
that's added, changed or deleted. Changes to the API must be proposed, discussed and approved with the ``API approved``
label in a separate issue before opening a PR.

DOs and DON'Ts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please do:

- Target your `PR <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_ at the `main` branch.
- Follow the coding style already present in the project.
- Use ReSharper (CLI) for inspection(s). A GitHub action is present which runs these inspections on every commit.
  So anything reported by ReSharper (CLI) will cause your pull request to be declined.
- Ensure that your changes are covered by new or existing tests.
- Ensure that the quality of your tests is sufficient by performing mutation testing using
  `Stryker <https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/introduction/>`_.
- Code coverage must be non-decreasing unless approved by the authors.
- If the contribution adds a feature or fixes a bug, please update the
  `release notes <https://kwalityuvault.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-notes.html>`_.
- If the contribution affects the documentation, please update the
  `documentation <https://kwalityuvault.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Please do not:

- Create big PR's. Instead, file an issue and discuss and start  a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you
  invest a large amount of time. This includes ``any`` change to the public API.
- Add dependencies to your favorite packages in the ``core`` library, instead opt for another design where your favorite
  library is included in an additional project.

Validate your work locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you submit a PR, you can run the test suite locally to be confident that your PR doesn't break any existing
functionality.

Since UVault closely integrates with Auth0, you need to sign up for a "free" Auth0 account.
Once your account is created, there are a couple of steps which needs to be performed.

- Inside your tenant's settings, change the value of the ``Default Directory`` to ``Username-Password-Authentication``.
- Create a ``Regular Web Application`` application in your tenant and enable the ``Password`` grant type.
- Create an API in your tenant, or use the default ``Auth0 Management API``.
- Create a user in your tenant which uses the ``Username-Password-Authentication`` connection.

Once you have your Auth0 account configured, the following environment variables needs to be set:

- ``AUTH0_AUDIENCE``: The API audience of the API in your tenant.
- ``AUTH0_CLIENT_ID``: The Client ID of the application in your tenant.
- ``AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET``: The Client Secret of the application in your tenant.
- ``AUTH0_TOKEN_ENDPOINT``: The endpoint of your Auth0 tenant used to authenticate.
- ``AUTH0_USERNAME``: The username of the created Auth0 user.
- ``AUTH0_PASSWORD``: The password of the created Auth0 user.
- ``AUTH0_VALID_AUDIENCE``: The audience that's supported by your Auth0 tenant.
- ``AUTH0_VALID_ISSUER``: The issuer that's supported by your Auth0 tenant.
