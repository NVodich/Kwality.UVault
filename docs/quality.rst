To ensure the ongoing compatibility of UVault with Auth0, a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is employed.
This pipeline incorporates nightly test executions that specifically target Auth0 functionalities, including the
creation of users, APIs, and grants, among others. By implementing this process, we can maintain confidence in the
consistent functionality of the code base in conjunction with Auth0.

The result of this pipeline can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/dotnet-essentials/Kwality.UVault/actions/workflows/CI%20-%20Auth0.yml>`_.
